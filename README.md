# Screen Time Analysis
Analyze the screen time of the user to find relationships between the usage of the smartphone and factors like notifications and apps used by the user.

## Overview

Screen Time Analysis involves analyzing and generating reports on which applications are used by the user and for how much time. Devices offer effective tools for creating screen time reports.  


For screen time analysis, an ideal dataset is available containing:  

- Date
- Usage of Applications
- Number of Notifications from Applications
- Number of times apps opened

You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/analyzing-screen-time).

Comparing the daily usage of Instagram and WhatsApp over time shows varying levels of screen time on different days. It seems like the user's interaction with these apps fluctuates significantly, with certain days showing high usage.

Tracking the number of notifications sent by Instagram and WhatsApp indicates that the amount of notifications does not remain constant. Some days have a high number of notifications, which might correlate with increased usage on those days.

Chart illustrates the frequency with which the apps were accessed each day. It appears that the user opens these apps numerous times throughout the day, with some days showing more app openings, potentially indicating higher engagement.

- The scatter plot depicts the relationship between the number of notifications and the overall usage of applications.

The scatter plot with a trendline demonstrates a positive correlation between the number of notifications received and the usage time of the apps. This suggests that receiving more notifications is likely associated with increased screen time.

Shows a positive correlation between the number of times the apps were opened and the screen time. This implies that more frequent app usage leads to higher overall screen time.

Chart for daily notifications shows a pattern that might be linked to the user's screen time. Days with higher notifications seem to align with increased usage, hinting at potential user responsiveness to incoming alerts.---

### Through this project, I've uncovered insights into digital behavior, specifically the strong influence of app notifications on screen time. The patterns show that more notifications tend to lead to more frequent app usage, highlighting the significant impact of app engagement on daily screen time.
