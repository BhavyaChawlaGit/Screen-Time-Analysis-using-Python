## Screen Time Analysis Overview

Screen Time Analysis involves analyzing and generating reports on which applications are used by the user and for how much time. Apple devices offer effective tools for creating screen time reports.  

For screen time analysis, an ideal dataset is available containing:  

- Date
- Usage of Applications
- Number of Notifications from Applications
- Number of times apps opened
